### Current Plan

*   **Task:** Change the theme of the website to a modern style.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Update `globals.css` to change the background, font, and color scheme to a modern, light theme.
    2.  Remove cyberpunk-specific styles like glitch effects and carbon fiber background.
    3.  Update components (`Navbar`, `ProjectCard`, etc.) to align with the new modern design.
    4.  Ensure the website is responsive.
    5.  Run `npm run lint -- --fix` to fix any linting issues.
