## **Current Plan**

*   **Task:** Restructure the skills page to include separate divisions for "Languages," "Frameworks," and "Others."
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Modified `src/app/skill/skills.tsx` to create three distinct sections for "Languages," "Frameworks," and "Others."
    2.  Added new skills to each category.
    3.  Updated `src/app/globals.css` with styles for the new sections.
    4.  Updated this `blueprint.md` file.
